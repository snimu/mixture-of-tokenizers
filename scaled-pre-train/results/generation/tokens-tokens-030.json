      ". In this paper, we present a novel approach to address this challenge by using a novel neural network model, the \ufffdB-Tree,\ufffd to solve the problem of robustness and alignment. The \ufffdB-Tree\ufffd model is based on the notion of a tree, which is a tree-like representation of a deep neural network, and is used to represent the network in a tree-like representation. The \ufffdB-Tree\ufffd model is then used to solve the problem of robustness and alignment of the deep neural network. The \ufffdB-Tree\ufffd model is implemented in a state-of-the-art deep neural network model, the \ufffdNeuralNet\ufffd, and is used to solve the problem of robustness and alignment of the deep neural network. The \ufffdB-Tree\ufffd model is also used to solve the problem of alignment and robustness of the deep neural network. The results show that the \ufffdB-Tree\ufffd model is able to provide robustness and alignment of the deep neural network.\n|Item Type:||Conference or Workshop Item (Paper)|\n|Subjects:||T Technology > TJ Mechanical engineering and machinery|\n|Deposited By:||Ms. Anjali K.
