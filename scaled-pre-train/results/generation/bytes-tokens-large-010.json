      ". In this paper, we propose a new approach to the robustness of deep neural networks. We use a novel approach to the robustness of deep neural networks, called the \ufffddynamic-dynamic-dynamic\ufffd (D-D-D) model. The D-D-D model is based on the fact that the network is a dynamic system, and that the network is dynamic in the sense that it is not static. The D-D-D model is based on the fact that the network is dynamic in the sense that it is not static.
